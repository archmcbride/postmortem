I think our group worked well together. We decided early on to do everything together instead of trying to split pieces out. We all felt that it would help us understand the whole process better. We wanted to work on all the parts: front end, server, & database, so that we could all have a better understanding of the concepts we've been learning. I think we picked a doable amount of work to accomplish, and, although we know there were many things we wanted to add, our basic app worked as intended. 

I didn't find much of the project to be frustrating. I liked working as a group and talking through the different pieces. It helped me see how the different aspects of the project connected. Each of us had a better understanding of different technologies, so that allowed us to work together. The only thing I can think might have helped me understand even more would have been to trade off typing into the computer. But, we made sure to walk through all of our code out loud, so I felt like it was clear what we were doing and how it worked. 

I feel like I have a much better understanding of the different technologies and how they relate to each other. I think it is still confusing which technology to use when, and they all sort of blur in my head. Terminology is tough, but that's just because we learned so many things in such a short amount of time. Continuing to work with all of it will help solidify things in my mind. It's just going to take time.

I thoroughly enjoyed having the group project. It really helped working together to figure out things we wanted to do. We also worked well defining things that we really wanted to do versus things that would be nice if we had more time. I was initially afraid we'd try to do too much, but we seemed to have settled on just the right amount to get done with the time allotted. I didn't feel like we were scrambling or unprepared for the presentation.
